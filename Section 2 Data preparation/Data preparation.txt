
Factor Variable Trap(FVT) :converting factor into non-factor 
eg.  x <- factor(c("11","12","13","14",'11'))
     y <- as.numeric(as.character(x))

sub() and gsub() perform replacement of 1st and all matches respectively.

If u want to address special character in its character meaning then u need to create an escape sequence.
eg. "\\$" for $

NA is 3rd logical constant.

In factors NA is represented as <NA> because factor can have "NA"(acronym for anything except not available) as 
element in some cases.
